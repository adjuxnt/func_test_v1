# Funksjonstesting 
Some testing of basic JavaScript functions for pupils at Dreamthorpe High School

In this presentation, we're testing how to define and run functions, by declaring them and calling them.

We're also testing how to declare functions with a parameter variable, so that we can send information to it as arguments.

Lastly we demonstrate how to return data from the function.
